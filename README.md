## Problem Statement
The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open-source dataset that includes information about power plants worldwide. It provides details on various attributes of power plants, such as their location, fuel type, capacity, and operational status, among others. This dataset is valuable for energy analysis and machine learning projects that involve capacity prediction of global powerplants. However, this dataset is characterized by several challenges, including missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Consequently, energy analysts and stakeholders face difficulties in accurately assessing energy generation patterns for effectively planning for future energy needs. The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly tool to predict and analyse energy generation in global market.

By building a machine learning model, this project aims to cover several steps like Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Selection, Training, Model Evaluation and Deployment. Machine Learning Algorithms used here are Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. These models are explored and compared based on performance metrices like RMSE, MSE, MAE and R² Score and best model is selected to predict the capacity of powerplants.

## Objective
**Energy Generation Analysis and Capacity Prediction of Global Power Plants**
To develop a predictive model that estimates the maximum capacity of power plants globally based on factors such as energy source, geographical location, and operational parameters. The goal is to provide accurate energy production forecasts that can aid in optimizing energy management and policy decisions, while also identifying key factors influencing power generation efficiency. The target variable or feature to be predicted is maximum capacity of powerplants.

* **capacity_mw** : The maximum electrical capacity of the power plant, measured in megawatts (MW).
* **latitude** : The geographical latitude of the power plant.
* **longitude** : The geographical longitude of the power plant.
* **primary_fuel** : The primary source of fuel used by the power plant (e.g., coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar).
* **other_fuel1** : An additional fuel source used by the power plant, if any.
* **other_fuel2** : A second additional fuel source used by the power plant, if any.
* **other_fuel3** : A third additional fuel source used by the power plant, if any.
* **commissioning_year** : The year the power plant was first commissioned and began operating.
* **owner** : The entity or company that owns the power plant.
* **source** : The source or origin of the data for this particular power plant.
* **url** : A link to a webpage containing further information about the power plant.
* **geolocation_source** : The source of the geolocation data (latitude/longitude) for the power plant.
* **wepp_id** : The ID from the World Electric Power Plants (WEPP) database.
* **year_of_capacity_data** : The year in which the capacity data was reported.
* **generation_gwh_2013** : The amount of energy generated by the power plant in 2013, measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh).
* **generation_gwh_2014** : The amount of energy generated by the power plant in 2014, measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

* **generation_gwh_2017** : The amount of energy generated by the power plant in 2017, measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh).
* **estimated_generation_gwh** : The estimated total energy generation for the power plant, measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh), where actual generation data is unavailable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
* The dataset contains 29910 rows and 24 columns.
* Dataset contain two types of datatypes namely object and float64.
* The dataset contain many null values.
* Number of numerical columns : 11
  
  They are 'capacity', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'commissioning_year', 'year_of_capacity_data', 'generation_gwh_2013', 'generation_gwh_2014', 'generation_gwh_2015', 'generation_gwh_2016', 'generation_gwh_2017', 'estimated_generation_gwh'.
  
  Number of categorical columns : 13
  
  They are 'country', 'country_long', 'name', 'gppd_idnr', 'fuel_type', 'other_fuel1', 'other_fuel2', 'other_fuel3', 'owner', 'source', 'url', 'geolocation_source', 'wepp_id'.
* Country that is mostly reported - USA
* Most used fuel type - Hydro
* Information collected mostly from U.S. Energy Information Administration

## Data Preprocessing
* Columns having more than 80% null values are removed.
* Columns with multicollinearity are removed.
* NaN values in numerical columns can be removed by either dropping rows or filling it with Mean, Median or Mode or any other appropriate value.
* Outliers are treated using IQR method.

## Feature Engineering
  Categorical columns are encoded using **Label Encoding**.

## Feature Selection
* **Random Forest Regressor** is used to select important features. Important features gathered are **'gppd_idnr', 'longitude', 'fuel_type', 'wepp_id', 'estimated_generation_gwh'.**

## Feature Scaling
Data is standardized using **standardScaler().**

## ML Model Building
Models used : 
* **Linear Regression**
* **Decision Tree Regressor**
* **Random Forest Regressor**
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
* **XGBoost Regressor**

## Model Evaluation
* Performance parameters used are **R² score, MSE, RMSE and MAE.**
* Select the model with the highest R² score (closer to 1 is better).
* Select the model with the lowest error values (lower values indicate better performance).
* R² Score is a good indicator of the overall model performance.
**Random Forest Regressor shows the highest R² Score. So, this model can be considered the best model.**

## Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearch CV is used for Hyperparameter tuning. After hyperparameter tuning, model performance improved. 

**XG Boost Regressor shows best performance.**

## Saving the Model
Best performing XG Boost model is saved.

## Pipeline Implementation

* Unseen data is created with selected features from feature selection.
* Numerical columns are encoded using label encoding.
* Capacities are predicted with unseen data.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of global power plant energy generation, revealing valuable insights into capacity patterns of powerplants across regions. The model demonstrated good predictive accuracy for powerplant capacity and identified key trends that could inform energy policy and investment.

Limitations of the Dataset : A key challenge in this project was managing data quality issues, including a significant number of missing values, NaNs, and outliers. For example, generation capacity data for some power plants was either incomplete or NaNs, which required careful imputation. Despite these challenges, data preprocessing steps ensured the model retained accuracy and robustness.

## Future Works
* **Enhance Model Performance and Robustness** : Incorporate Additional Features related to environmental conditions like temperature, rainfall etc. to capture more factors influencing power generation. Experimenting with advanced machine learning models, such as Time-series forecasting methods for predicting energy generation over time also works best.
* **Geospatial Analysis** : Since power plants are geographically distributed, geospatial analyses using location-based features like cities, rivers, or ports could reveal insights into regional factors affecting power generation.
* **Develop a Real-Time Dashboard or Monitoring System** : Creating a real-time or interactive dashboard could provide stakeholders with up-to-date insights into power generation trends, supporting data-driven decision-making in energy management.
* **Collect and Utilize More Data** : Additional data sources could improve model reliability and make predictions applicable to a broader regions. This can help in studying areas with energy surpluses or shortages, aiding in effective resource allocation.
