## Problem Statement
The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open-source dataset that includes information about power plants worldwide. It provides details on various attributes of power plants, such as their location, fuel type, capacity, and operational status, among others. This dataset is valuable for energy analysis and machine learning projects that involve capacity prediction of global powerplants. However, this dataset is characterized by several challenges, including missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Consequently, energy analysts and stakeholders face difficulties in accurately assessing energy generation patterns for effectively planning for future energy needs. The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly tool to predict and analyse energy generation in global market.

By building a machine learning model, this project aims to cover several steps like Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Selection, Training, Model Evaluation and Deployment. Machine Learning Algorithms used here are Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. These models are explored and compared based on performance metrices like RMSE, MSE, MAE and RÂ² Score and best model is selected to predict the energy(capacity) generation of powerplants.

## Objective
Energy Generation Analysis and Capacity Prediction of Global Power Plants
To develop a predictive model that estimates the maximum capacity of power plants globally based on factors such as energy source, geographical location, and operational parameters. The goal is to provide accurate energy production forecasts that can aid in optimizing energy management and policy decisions, while also identifying key factors influencing power generation efficiency. The target variable or feature to be predicted is maximum capacity of powerplants.

## Data Description
Here is a description of each column in the global powerplant database:
